## Work in Progress
**Work-from-Home, Foot Traffic, and Retail Amenities.**

As hybrid and remote work becomes more common, how does the reduction in commuter foot traffic affect retail amenities and consumer welfare? Using cell phone location data, we investigate how visits to venues change when remote workers no longer travel from the office nor the commuting path. We also examine the resulting effects on retailer profits, entry, and exit.

**The Welfare Effects of Efficiency Innovations in Residential Land Use.** 

More efficient use of residential land could mitigate housing supply and affordability concerns. One increasingly common innovation is the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) attached to or on the same lot as a primary residence. We quantify the effects of ADUs on house prices, rents, and resident welfare.


## Working Papers
**Pandemic Movement Patterns and the Heterogeneous Value of a Statistical Life.**

We study the trade-offs that consumers faced when choosing whether to visit venues like stores and restaurants during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, we estimate heterogeneous fatality rates using the health outcomes of millions of COVID-19 patients.  Then, using a panel of cell phone location data tracking visits to venues before and during the pandemic, we examine how the responsiveness to infection-related mortality risk varied across age groups. Our results suggest that older peopleâ€™s movements are less sensitive to mortality risk. Under weak assumptions, this implies that older people have a lower willingness to pay for marginal reductions in the probability of death. This finding has implications for the cost-benefit analysis of policies that mitigate adverse health outcomes, such as pandemic movement restrictions and pollution remediation, and for the value of statistical life (VSL) literature more broadly.
